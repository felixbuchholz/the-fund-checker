    <p style="font-size: 0.8em">In 2018, the call to <span class ="font-weight-bold"> “Give Each Share An Equal Vote” at Facebook and Google</span> received support from the highest amount of funds voting on that proposal. (Obviously, these companies are held in many funds.) <br>In <a href=
    "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680118000022/facebook2018definitiveprox.htm#sC329C21BFA8D5EA195DEB4D42522854C" target = "_blank" > Facebook’s case 21.34% </a>of overall shareholder supported this proposal, and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000130817918000222/lgoog2018-def14a.htm"
     target="_blank">28.92% of Google’s shareholders </a> - meaning both shareholder meetings rejected the change to equal vote. <br> We see this proposal return in 2019 for both companies  - failing to pass, with similar support levels.

      </ol> <br>
      The 3 most active funds (still trading) are managed by State Street, supporting ESG issues between 35% to 27% of the cases. As a side note, one can say that funds that gravitate towards more ESG-friendly companies would need to provoke less change by proxy voting - as the companies would be more ESG to start with.
